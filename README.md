# Macroeconomic Dynamics of Japan: Consumption Behaviour, Phillips Curve Breakdown, Monetary Policy, and GDP Forecasting

## Introduction
This project provides an econometric and theoretical analysis of Japan’s macroeconomic environment. Using real datasets on GDP, CPI, unemployment, and policy rates, the study investigates Japan’s growth trends, inflation dynamics, consumption behaviour, and the breakdown of the Phillips Curve. Visual models such as IS–LM and AD–AS are incorporated to interpret structural issues in Japan’s economy.


## Objectives
- To forecast Japan’s GDP using ARIMA/SARIMAX models.
- To estimate Japan’s consumption function using regression analysis.
- To test the validity of the Phillips Curve for Japan.
- To evaluate the effectiveness of monetary policy in a low-interest, near-deflation environment.
- To illustrate macroeconomic relationships using IS–LM and AD–AS curve plots.
